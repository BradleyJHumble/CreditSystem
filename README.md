# CreditSystem
An web application example of an credit system. Users buy credits and can use them for services. It is good for when you have small purchases but don't want the high fees of credit charging. So instead of an 33 cents charge for an dollar service you can get an credit of 10 from users to spend on services. This makes the costs of credit processing from 33% to 5.9%. (On $1 versus $10).
